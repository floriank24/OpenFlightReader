    continuation records
    The continuation record appears in
    the stream immediately following the record that it “continues”. The data contained in the continuation
    record is defined by the original record and is assumed to be directly appended onto
    the content of the original record. Multiple continuation records may follow a record, in which case
    all continuation records would be appended (in sequence) to the original record
